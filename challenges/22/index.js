/**
 * Project Euler: Problem 22: Names scores
 * Using names, an array containing over five-thousand first names,
 * begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the
 * alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical
 * position in the list to obtain a name score.
 *
 * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
 * which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
 * So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
 *
 * What is the total of all the name scores in the file? */
